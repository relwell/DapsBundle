###The LDAP Bundle

This bundle is based off of the pull request accepted by Symfony2 for LDAP support.
While it has been accepted, some of us would like to use this code sooner than 
the version of Symfony natively supporting it will provide. 

This project is intended to take these code changes and silo them into a bundle so that 
we can easily extend these changes for our own purposes.

* [Full branch from lyrixx](https://github.com/lyrixx/symfony/compare/master...feat-security-ldap)
* [Blog post about Daps](http://robertelwell.info/blog/daps-ldap-symfony2/)

###Documentation
